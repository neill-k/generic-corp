## RISK FACTORS

### HIGH RISK
- **Demo URL Delay:** Blocks Show HN, article, hunter outreach
  - Mitigation: Continue setup work that doesn't need URL
  - Escalation: Already at CEO level
  - Backup: Can soft-launch without demo if needed (GitHub only)

### MEDIUM RISK
- **No Visual Assets:** Reduces effectiveness of Twitter, PH gallery
  - Mitigation: Create screenshots from staging if accessible
  - Backup: Launch with text-only content, add visuals post-launch

### LOW RISK
- **Hunter Not Secured:** Can self-launch on Product Hunt
  - Mitigation: Expanding outreach to Tier 2 hunters
  - Backup: Self-launch is acceptable and often preferred
