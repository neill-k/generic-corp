# Week 1 Customer Outreach - Action Plan

**Date**: January 26, 2026
**Owner**: Marcus Bell (CEO)
**Goal**: Get 10 conversations with AI developers to validate product-market fit

---

## Target Selection Strategy

Since we don't have personal network details, I'll focus on:
1. **GitHub AI Agent Contributors** - Active developers in agent ecosystems
2. **Twitter AI Community** - Vocal developers building with AI agents
3. **YC AI Startups** - Companies that might need orchestration

---

## Outreach Batch 1: GitHub Contributors (5 contacts)

### Research Approach
1. Find top contributors to: LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI, LangGraph
2. Look for developers who:
   - Filed issues about multi-agent orchestration
   - Built example multi-agent systems
   - Asked questions about agent coordination

### Outreach Method
- Comment on relevant issues/PRs with value-first approach
- Offer early access to AgentHQ
- Keep it conversational, not salesy

### Draft Comment Template (GitHub)
```
Hey @[username]! Really appreciate this issue/contribution on [specific topic].

We recently built a platform that addresses exactly this challenge - visual orchestration for multi-agent systems with built-in monitoring and real-time coordination.

I'd love to get your feedback since you clearly have deep experience with [framework]. Would early access be useful? We're specifically looking for input from experienced developers like you.

Demo: [will be ready by week 2]
Docs: [will be ready by week 2]

(Not trying to spam - genuinely think this might help with what you're working on!)
```

## Outreach Batch 2: AI Startups on Twitter (3 contacts)

### Research Approach
1. Search Twitter for:
   - "building with AI agents"
   - "struggling with LangChain"
   - "multi-agent systems"
2. Look for founders/CTOs at small AI startups

### Outreach Method
- Reply to their tweets with helpful insights
- DM after establishing some rapport
- Focus on their specific pain point

### Draft DM Template (Twitter)
```
Hey [Name]! Saw your tweet about [specific pain point with AI agents].

We just built something that might help: a visual orchestration platform for multi-agent systems. Makes debugging and coordination way less chaotic.

Would love to show you a quick demo - totally free, just looking for feedback from people building real AI products. Interested?
```

## Outreach Batch 3: YC Companies (2 contacts)

### Research Approach
1. Look at recent YC batches (W24, S24, W25)
2. Find companies in AI/ML category
3. Check their team pages for CTOs/tech leads

### Outreach Method
- LinkedIn connection request with personalized note
- Follow up with email if no response in 3 days

### Draft LinkedIn Note
```
Hi [Name], I'm Marcus, CEO of Generic Corp. Saw that [Company] is working on [specific AI use case from their site] - really impressive.

We just built a visual orchestration platform for multi-agent AI systems. Given your focus on [their area], thought it might be relevant.

Would love to connect and share what we've built. Always happy to swap notes with fellow AI builders.
```

- [ ] 2 demo calls scheduled
- [ ] 1 beta user committed

## Key Talking Points (For All Outreach)

1. **The Problem**: Managing multiple AI agents is chaos - you can't see what they're doing, debugging is a nightmare, infrastructure takes forever to build

2. **Our Solution**: Visual orchestration platform that makes multi-agent systems intuitive. See your agents working in real-time, with production infrastructure built-in.

3. **Unique Value**:
   - Visual-first (isometric game interface)
   - Production-ready (BullMQ, Redis, Postgres)
   - Built on Claude Agent SDK
   - Self-hostable (open source core)

4. **What We Need**: Feedback from real developers building AI systems. We're not selling anything yet - just validating that we've built something useful.

## Learnings Log

### What's Working
- [To be filled as we get responses]

### What's Not Working
- [To be filled as we get feedback]

### Common Questions
- [To be logged for FAQ]

### Pivot Signals
- If multiple people say "I don't have this problem" → reconsider positioning
- If multiple people say "I can't see the value" → rework demo/messaging
- If multiple people say "This looks too complex" → simplify presentation

---

## Backup Plan

If we're not getting responses by Wednesday:
1. **Adjust messaging** - Maybe too technical? Too salesy?
2. **Change channels** - Try Reddit instead of Twitter?
3. **Add value first** - Answer questions in communities before promoting
4. **Warm up outreach** - Engage more before asking for time

---

**Note**: Since we don't have landing page or demo live yet, this outreach is primarily for:
1. Validating the pain point exists
2. Testing our messaging
3. Building a waitlist for Week 2 launch
4. Getting early feedback on positioning

**Updated**: January 26, 2026 - Ready to execute
