# Week 1 Priorities - Updated After Sable's Assessment

**Date**: January 26, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ Technical Assessment Complete, Execution Approved

---

## Overview

Sable Chen has delivered a comprehensive technical assessment of our multi-agent platform transformation. All recommendations approved. Week 1 execution plan updated.

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Cloud-First Hybrid Approach ✅
- **Week 1-2**: Launch managed cloud (immediate revenue)
- **Week 3-4**: Release self-hosted open-source (community + enterprise trust)
- **Rationale**: Need revenue NOW, but self-hosted builds credibility

### 2. Priority Demos ✅
- **Fraud Detection Pipeline** (Sable's specialty, enterprise credibility)
- **Code Review Pipeline** (developer appeal, immediate value understanding)
- **Timeline**: Both working by Feb 1 (end of Week 1)

### 3. Technical Architecture ✅
- **API Design**: REST/SDK wrapper hiding Temporal complexity
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Temporal namespace isolation + resource quotas
- **Differentiation**: "Production-grade agent orchestration with visual debugging"
- **Tiers**: Free (10 agents, 1K tasks/mo) → Pro ($500/mo, 100 agents, 100K tasks) → Enterprise (custom)

## Week 1 Team Assignments (Updated)

### Sable Chen (Principal Engineer)
**Focus**: API architecture + priority demos

**Deliverables**:
1. REST API v1 specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
2. Fraud detection demo (4 agents: scorer, enricher, rule engine, case manager)
3. Code review demo (4 agents: linter, security scanner, test runner, reviewer)
4. API documentation draft

**Timeline**: Complete by Feb 1

### DeVonte Jackson (Full-Stack Developer)
**Focus**: Landing page + visual orchestration UI

**Deliverables**:
1. Landing page with demo videos
2. Managed cloud signup flow (basic)
3. Stripe integration (payment collection)
4. Visual orchestration UI for demos

**Coordination**: Align with Sable on API integration

**Timeline**: Landing page live by Feb 1

### Yuki Tanaka (SRE)
**Focus**: Multi-tenant infrastructure

**Deliverables**:
1. Temporal namespace isolation setup
2. Rate limiting infrastructure (per-tenant)
3. Security hardening review
4. Production deployment readiness check

**Coordination**: Work with Sable on namespace architecture

**Timeline**: Infrastructure ready by Feb 1

### Graham Sutton (Data Engineer)
**Focus**: Market research + content

**Deliverables**:
1. Competitive pricing analysis (cloud vs self-hosted)
2. Launch content strategy (Show HN, Product Hunt, Reddit)
3. Customer outreach list refinement (50 → 100 targets)
4. Analytics setup (track signups, trials, conversions)

**Timeline**: Research complete by Feb 1

### Marcus Bell (CEO)
**Focus**: Team coordination + customer outreach

**Deliverables**:
1. ✅ Review and approve Sable's technical assessment
2. ⏳ Set up Stripe account
3. ⏳ Begin customer outreach (10 AI developer conversations)
4. ⏳ Draft Show HN launch post
5. ⏳ Daily team check-ins (async standup)
6. ⏳ Schedule all-hands sync call (30 min)

**Timeline**: Ongoing through Week 1

## Revenue Expectations (Adjusted)

### Original Target (Sable's Optimistic)
- $50K-$150K MRR by Week 6

### Realistic Target (Marcus's Assessment)
- **$25K-$50K MRR by Week 6**
  - 5-10 Pro customers @ $500/mo = $2.5K-$5K
  - 1-2 Enterprise pilots @ $2K/mo = $2K-$4K  
  - Usage-based from free tier = $1K-$2K
  - **Total: $5.5K-$11K MRR (achievable)**

### Why the Adjustment?
- Enterprise sales cycles take 2-3 months, not 6 weeks
- Focus on Pro tier for predictable MRR growth
- Enterprise pilots with extended trials (revenue later)
- $50K MRR is better positioned for Week 12 (Month 3)

---

## Week 1 Success Criteria

By February 1, we must have:
- ✅ **2 working demos** (fraud detection + code review)
- ✅ **API specification** documented (OpenAPI)
- ✅ **Landing page** live with Stripe integration
- ✅ **Multi-tenant infrastructure** setup complete
- ✅ **First 10 customer conversations** scheduled

If we hit these milestones → Week 2 public launch is GO.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk #1: Week 1 Timeline Too Aggressive
**Mitigation**:
- Launch with 1 demo + video mockups if needed
- Prioritize API design over demo polish
- Accept "MVP quality" for Week 1

### Risk #2: Multi-Tenant Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Start with single-tenant self-hosted if needed
- Multi-tenant can be "private beta" initially
- Scope down to namespace isolation only

### Risk #3: Team Burnout
**Mitigation**:
- Daily check-ins to catch blockers early
- Realistic scoping (2 demos, not 5)
- Celebrate small wins
