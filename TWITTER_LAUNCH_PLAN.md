## Pre-Launch Content Strategy (T-7 to Launch)

### Day 1 (TODAY) - Account Creation

**Tweet 1 (First Tweet - Set the Tone):**
```
We're building a visual debugger for Claude Code agent swarms. 🔍⚡

Real-time dashboard with bidirectional sync. Open source. TypeScript.

Launching on Show HN this Tuesday.

Follow along if you're into AI agents, developer tools, or building cool stuff. 👋
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear value prop
- Technical credibility (TypeScript, open source)
- Concrete launch date (creates urgency)
- Friendly invitation (not salesy)

**Tweet 2 (4 hours later - Show the Problem):**
```
Ever debug an AI agent swarm by tailing logs for hours?

Yeah, us too.

That's why we're building this. [Screenshot or GIF of dashboard]

Launching Tuesday. 🚀
```

**Why this works:**
- Relatable pain point
- Visual proof
- Reinforces launch date

### Day 2 (T-6) - Build Anticipation

**Tweet 3 (Morning - Technical Depth):**
```
Building real-time sync for agent dashboards is wild.

The challenge: Keep UI and filesystem in sync with <200ms latency when agents create/update tasks every few seconds.

The solution: File watchers + WebSocket rooms + Redis pub/sub.

More details after launch. 👀
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows technical chops
- Hints at solution (creates curiosity)
- Builds credibility with engineers

**Tweet 4 (Evening - Social Proof):**
```
Beta feedback so far:

"This is what I've been needing!"
"Finally, visual debugging for agent swarms"
"The bidirectional sync is chef's kiss"

Launching this Tuesday on Show HN.

What would you use this for? 💬
```

**Why this works:**
- Social proof (quotes)
- Asks engaging question
- Reinforces launch timing

### Day 3 (T-5) - Show the Product

**Tweet 5 (Morning - First Demo):**
```
30-second tour of Claude Code Dashboard:

✅ Kanban board with real-time updates
✅ Agent characters with status
✅ Activity stream
✅ Sub-200ms WebSocket sync

Show HN launch: This Tuesday, 9 AM EST.

[Attach 30-second demo video or GIF]
```

**Why this works:**
- Visual proof (video/GIF)
- Specific features
- Exact launch time

**Tweet 6 (Evening - Behind the Scenes):**
```
Late night launch prep:

✅ Polish dashboard UI
✅ Write Show HN post
✅ Test demo on fresh machine
✅ Prep support for traffic spike
⏳ Stress test WebSocket infra

52 hours until Show HN. Let's go. 🔥
```

**Why this works:**
- Humanizes the launch
- Shows preparation (builds confidence)
- Countdown creates urgency

### Day 4 (T-4) - Community Building

**Tweet 7 (Morning - Ask for Engagement):**
```
Quick poll for devs building with AI agents:

What's your biggest debugging challenge?

🔹 No visibility into agent state
🔹 Can't reproduce failures
🔹 Lost in log files
🔹 Something else (reply!)

Launching a solution Tuesday. 👀
```

**Why this works:**
- Polls get high engagement
- Validates problem
- Invites conversation

**Tweet 8 (Afternoon - Ecosystem Play):**
```
Shoutout to @AnthropicAI for Claude Agent SDK. 🙌

Building on top of it has been amazing. The primitives are solid, and the docs are clear.

We're adding visual debugging on top. Real-time dashboard for agent swarms.

Show HN launch: Tuesday, 9 AM EST.
```

**Why this works:**
- Tags Anthropic (potential retweet)
- Shows ecosystem alignment
- Positions as complementary (not competing)

### Day 5 (T-3) - Teaser Campaign

**Tweet 9 (Morning - Sneak Peek):**
```
Sneak peek: Agent characters with speech bubbles. 💬

Watch them work in real-time, see status updates, track progress.

Launching this Tuesday on Show HN.

[GIF or screenshot of agent view]
```

**Why this works:**
- Visual appeal (isometric view interesting)
- Unique feature (not typical dashboard)
- Continues drumbeat

**Tweet 10 (Evening - Value Prop):**
```
Claude Code Dashboard in one tweet:

Visual debugger for agent swarms. Real-time sync. Edit in UI or filesystem. Both work. Sub-200ms latency. Open source.

Show HN launch: Tuesday, 9 AM EST.

What questions do you have? 💬
```

**Why this works:**
- Concise value prop
- Invites questions (engagement)
- Clear launch timing

### Day 6 (T-2) - Final Push

**Tweet 11 (Morning - Social Proof):**
```
30 beta users tested Claude Code Dashboard.

The most common feedback?

"Why didn't this exist sooner?"
