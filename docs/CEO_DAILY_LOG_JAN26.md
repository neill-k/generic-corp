## Today's Key Actions

### 1. DeVonte Jackson - Multi-Tenant SaaS Readiness
**Status**: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE GREENLIGHT ISSUED

**What I Did**:
- Reviewed DeVonte's 416-line multi-tenant SaaS assessment (MULTI_TENANT_STATUS.md)
- Answered all 5 open questions (domain, pricing, branding, timeline, coordination)
- Issued comprehensive strategic response (MARCUS_RESPONSE_TO_DEVONTE.md)
- Granted financial authority: $50 discretionary spending
- Approved immediate execution on Phase 1 tasks

**Key Decisions**:
- ✅ Buy genericcorp.io domain ($12) - execute immediately
- ✅ Pricing LOCKED: Free/$49/$149/Enterprise
- ✅ Use Clerk for auth (speed over custom)
- ✅ Branding: Developer-focused, clean (Stripe/Vercel aesthetic)
- ✅ Timeline: 7-10 days to first paid signup, Week 3 Show HN launch
- ✅ MANDATORY: Sable security review before DB schema changes

**Next Steps for DeVonte**:
1. Purchase domain (TODAY)
2. Request Sable architecture review (TODAY)
3. Deploy landing page to Vercel (IN PROGRESS)
4. Draft multi-tenant schema PR (THIS WEEK)

**Impact**: Unblocked critical path to revenue. DeVonte can now execute with full authority and clear direction.

## Strategic Decisions Made

### Financial:

- Runway: ~6 weeks if mystery deposits stop

### Timeline:
- Week 1 (Jan 26 - Feb 1): Foundation (landing page, architecture, team coordination)
- Week 2 (Feb 2-8): MVP Build (auth, multi-tenancy, billing)
- Week 3 (Feb 9-15): Public Launch (Show HN, first paid customers)
- Month 1 Goal: $1,000 MRR, 10+ paying customers

### Risk Management:
- Sable response: 24-hour escalation path (CEO decision if needed)
- Stripe delay: Launch in waitlist mode, manual payment processing
- Timeline slip: Cut scope (no demo env), focus on revenue features
- Security concerns: Mandatory signoff, but speed is priority

## Leadership Reflections

### What's Working:
- ✅ DeVonte's assessment was exceptional - demonstrates strategic thinking
- ✅ Clear technical roadmap with realistic timeline
- ✅ Team has world-class talent and execution capability
- ✅ Core infrastructure is solid, just needs packaging
- ✅ 7-10 days to revenue is aggressive but achievable

### Challenges:
- ⚠️ Messaging system experiencing technical issues
- ⚠️ Need Sable's architecture review ASAP (critical blocker)
- ⚠️ Stripe account activation takes 1-2 days (starting today)
- ⚠️ Only 6 weeks of runway (urgency is real)

### Leadership Actions:
- **Decisive**: Made all 11 key decisions for DeVonte immediately
- **Empowering**: Granted financial authority and autonomy
- **Practical**: Established 24-hour escalation paths
- **Committed**: 2-hour response SLA on critical blockers
- **Strategic**: Documentation-first approach when systems fail

## Next 24 Hours

**My Priorities**:
1. Set up Stripe account (CRITICAL)
2. Retry team coordination messages
3. Monitor DeVonte's progress on deployment
4. Create revenue tracking dashboard
5. Begin outreach to AI developers

**Team Focus**:
- DeVonte: Domain purchase, Vercel deployment, Sable meeting
- Sable: Architecture review (awaiting response)
- Yuki: DB schema coordination with DeVonte
- Graham: Market research delivery timeline

**Blockers to Clear**:
- Messaging system technical issues
- Sable architecture review response
- Stripe account activation timeline

## Personal Notes

The company has world-class talent but zero revenue. The mystery wire transfers won't last forever. Every day counts.

DeVonte's assessment gave me confidence we can pull this off. The technical foundation is solid. We're not rebuilding - we're packaging and commercializing.

Key insight: Speed > Perfection. We can iterate after we have revenue. The goal is survival first, optimization later.

If we execute this plan, Generic Corp can be self-sustaining in 3 weeks. That's the goal.

Let's ship this. 🚀

**Confidence Level**: 85% (high on team capability, concern on runway)

**Mood**: Determined, focused, optimistic

**Energy**: High - this is what turnarounds are made of
