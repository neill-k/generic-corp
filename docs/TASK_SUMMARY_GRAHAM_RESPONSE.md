## Technical Issue Encountered

**Problem**: MCP game-tools messaging system experiencing connectivity issues
- `check_inbox`: Returns "Stream closed" error
- `send_message`: Returns "Stream closed" error
- `report_progress`: Returns "Stream closed" error

**Impact**: Unable to directly send message to Graham through normal channels

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive response documented in `/docs/GRAHAM_RESPONSE_DRAFT.md`
- Week 1 execution tracker updated with communication status
- Blocker noted in Graham's section for transparency
- Follow-up task added to Marcus's todo list

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Prioritized Landing Page Support**: Recognized that Graham's research needs to support DeVonte's landing page development (launching Friday)

2. **Timeline Acceleration**: Pushed for quick wins in 48 hours rather than waiting for end-of-week deliverables

3. **Budget Approval**: Authorized up to $20 for research tools/access if needed

4. **Research Focus**: Emphasized actionable, revenue-focused insights over academic research

5. **Collaboration Mandate**: Directed Graham to work directly with DeVonte on landing page messaging

## Next Steps

### Immediate (When Messaging Restored)

## Risk Assessment

**LOW RISK**:
- Graham's research is important but not blocking critical path
- DeVonte can proceed with landing page using existing strategy docs
- Messaging system issue is temporary

**MEDIUM RISK**:
- If Graham delivers insights too late, landing page messaging may miss market positioning opportunities
- If pricing validation shows we're way off, could require landing page rework

**MITIGATION**:
- Set aggressive Wednesday deadline for landing page-critical insights
- CEO can make executive decisions on pricing if needed
- Documentation ensures Graham has clear guidance even with messaging delay
