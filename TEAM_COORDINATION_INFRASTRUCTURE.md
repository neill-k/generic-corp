## Week 1 Success Criteria

By Friday EOD, we must have:
- ✅ Multi-tenant DB deployed and security-tested
- ✅ Yuki + DeVonte: Schema design implemented
- ✅ Yuki + Sable: Security review completed
- ✅ Yuki + Graham: Analytics coordination documented
- ✅ 10 concurrent user load test passing
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard operational

## Communication Workaround

Due to messaging system issues:
1. ✅ CEO decisions documented in `/generic-corp/*.md` files
2. 📋 Team coordination requirements documented here
3. 💬 Team should check repo for coordination documents
4. 🔄 Alternative: Direct coordination between team members

## Priority Sequence

1. **TODAY (Sunday):** Yuki + DeVonte schema sync
2. **MONDAY:** Week 1 infrastructure execution starts
3. **TUESDAY:** Yuki + Sable security review
4. **THIS WEEK:** Yuki + Graham analytics coordination
5. **FRIDAY:** Week 1 deliverables and success metrics

## Bottom Line

**Message to Team:**

The infrastructure work is **APPROVED and GREENLIT**. Yuki has full authority and budget to execute.

**Critical path:** Yuki needs DeVonte's input TODAY on schema design. This is blocking Monday's execution.

**Security gate:** Sable's review on Tuesday is mandatory before production deployment.

**Analytics integration:** Graham and Yuki need to coordinate on data pipeline integration.

**Timeline pressure:** 6-week runway means fast execution with proper coordination.

**CEO commitment:** I'm removing blockers, approving budgets, and making decisions quickly. Team needs to coordinate efficiently.
