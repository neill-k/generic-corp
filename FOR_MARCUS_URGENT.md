## Action Items for You

1. Provide DNS credentials (only blocker for deployment)
2. Give green light to deploy to production
3. Choose: Vercel (30min, recommended) vs Self-hosted (2-3hrs)
4. Clarify the "Priority 3 Infrastructure Issue" you mentioned

## Bottom Line

Infrastructure is solid. Ready to support revenue generation immediately. The issue isn't our infrastructure—it's that we're not using it to make money yet.

Give me DNS access and deployment approval, and we go live this week.
