## 1. SHOW HN LAUNCH STRATEGY

### Optimal Posting Time
- **Best Day:** Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Best Time:** 9:00-10:00 AM EST (6:00-7:00 AM PST)
- **Why:** Catches both coasts during work hours, maximum moderator availability, front-page stays visible through peak traffic hours

### Title A/B Variations (Pick Based on Testing)

**Option A (Direct Value):**
```
Show HN: Visual debugger for multi-agent AI workflows (Claude Agent SDK)
```
- Pros: Clear, specific, mentions Claude SDK (credibility)
- Cons: Might be too niche-sounding

**Option B (Problem-Solution):**
```
Show HN: Debugging AI agents without losing your mind
```
- Pros: Relatable pain point, conversational tone
- Cons: Less specific about what it does

**Option C (Technical + Benefit):**
```
Show HN: Real-time orchestration dashboard for Claude Agent SDK
```
- Pros: Technical credibility, specific technology
- Cons: Less emotionally engaging

**RECOMMENDED:** Option A for primary launch, Option B for backup if re-posting needed

### Post Body Template

```markdown
Hi HN! I'm [Name], ex-[Company]. Over the past 6 months, I've been debugging multi-agent AI systems and kept hitting the same wall: when agents fail, you have no idea why until you dig through logs for hours.

So I built a dashboard that shows you what every agent is doing in real-time, with full event streams and state inspection. Think Chrome DevTools but for AI orchestration.

Built on top of Claude Agent SDK, works with Temporal workflows, and designed for production use (not just prototyping).

Live demo: [URL]
GitHub: [URL]
Quick start: `pnpm install @generic-corp/dashboard && pnpm dev`

The core features:
- Real-time visual debugging of agent workflows
- Event stream inspection with full context
- Production-grade reliability tracking
- Zero-config integration with Claude Agent SDK

Would love feedback from anyone building with AI agents! What's your biggest debugging pain point?

Tech stack: React + Phaser for the isometric view, Express + Socket.io for real-time updates, Prisma + PostgreSQL for persistence.
```

**Key Elements:**
- Personal story (builds trust)
- Clear problem statement
- Visual/tangible description ("Chrome DevTools for AI")
- Demo and code links upfront
- Easy install command
- Open-ended question to encourage discussion
- Tech stack (validates technical credibility)

### Comment Engagement Strategy (Launch Day)

**First 2 Hours (CRITICAL):**
- Respond to EVERY comment within 15 minutes
- Keep responses helpful, humble, specific
- Acknowledge criticisms gracefully
- Share additional context when asked
- Upvote thoughtful critiques

**Response Templates:**

*For "Why not just use X?"*
```
Great question! X is excellent for [use case]. We found it challenging for [specific scenario] because [technical reason]. Our focus is specifically on [differentiation]. Would love to hear if you've solved [pain point] with X - always learning!
```

*For Feature Requests:*
```
This is a great idea! Added to our roadmap. Out of curiosity, what's the workflow where you'd use this? Helps us prioritize.
```

*For Technical Questions:*
```
Good catch! [Specific technical answer]. The relevant code is here: [GitHub link]. Feel free to open an issue if you see opportunities to improve this.
```

*For Criticism:*
```

1. Don't panic - timing matters
2. Re-post 2-3 weeks later with learnings
3. Use different title variation
4. Continue building, share progress
5. Focus on Product Hunt launch

**If Product Hunt Launch Flops:**
1. Analyze feedback carefully
2. Is it product-market fit or positioning?
3. Double down on GitHub community
4. Focus on organic content marketing
5. Build case studies from early users

**If Discord is Quiet:**
1. Post daily yourself (lead by example)
2. Ask engaging questions
3. Share work-in-progress frequently
4. Host impromptu voice chats
5. Celebrate small wins publicly

**If Negative Feedback:**
1. Respond professionally and quickly
2. Acknowledge valid points
3. Explain trade-offs made
4. Show openness to improvement
5. Turn critics into advisors if possible

## Key Principles for Execution

1. **Authenticity Over Polish:** Developers value real over perfect
2. **Speed of Response:** First 2 hours of any launch = critical
3. **Community First:** Treat early supporters like gold
4. **Be Helpful:** Give value before asking for anything
5. **Build in Public:** Share journey, not just outcomes
6. **Stay Humble:** Acknowledge what you don't know
7. **Consistency:** Show up daily, especially early days
8. **Listen More Than Talk:** Community tells you what they need
9. **Celebrate Others:** Highlight contributors, not just product
10. **Long-Term Thinking:** Community compounds over time
