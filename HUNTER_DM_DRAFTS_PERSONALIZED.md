## TIER 1 TARGET #1: Chris Messina (@chrismessina)

**Background Research:**
- OG Product Hunt hunter, coined the hashtag
- Focuses on: Developer tools, AI/ML products, social platforms
- Recent hunts: Multiple successful dev tools with high engagement
- Active on: Twitter, Product Hunt
- Best approach: Twitter DM

**Personalized DM:**

**Subject:** Quick question about hunting a Claude Code dev tool

```
Hey Chris! 👋

I've followed your hunts for years (you basically defined the category). Your hunt of [recent product - research his last 3 hunts] really stood out - [specific insight about why it was good].

Quick pitch: We built a visual debugger for Claude Code agent swarms. Think Chrome DevTools but for multi-agent AI orchestration.

Launching Tuesday (week after our Show HN launch) and looking for a hunter who gets developer workflows. Early feedback from ex-Google/Stripe engineers has been great.

Would you be interested in hunting it?

Key differentiators:
- First dashboard built specifically for Claude Code
- Real-time bidirectional sync (edit in UI or filesystem, both work)
- Sub-200ms WebSocket latency for agent coordination

30-sec demo: [DEMO_URL]
GitHub: [GITHUB_URL]

No worries if your schedule is full - totally understand!

Best,

**Why This Works:**
- Shows genuine familiarity with his work
- Positions him as category expert
- Technical credibility (Chrome DevTools comparison)
- Specific differentiators
- Respectful of his time

**Follow-Up (If No Response in 48h):**
```
Hey Chris - following up on my note from Monday.

Totally fine if you're not interested or schedule is full! Just wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in DMs.

Either way, appreciate you considering it!

## TIER 1 TARGET #2: Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover)

**Background Research:**
- Product Hunt founder, selective about hunts now
- Focuses on: Indie makers, developer tools, creative products
- Recent hunts: Still occasionally hunts products he's personally excited about
- Active on: Twitter, Product Hunt
- Best approach: Twitter DM or LinkedIn

**Personalized DM:**

**Subject:** Developer tool launch - would love your thoughts

```
Hey Ryan!

Longtime Product Hunt community member here. I've been building in the dev tools space and would be honored to have you hunt our launch.

Product: Claude Code Dashboard - visual debugger for multi-agent AI systems

The story: After debugging agent swarms by tailing logs for months, we built the dashboard we wished existed. Now 30+ beta users (mostly ex-FAANG engineers) are telling us this should exist for the whole ecosystem.

Why it matters: AI agents are going mainstream, but debugging them is still painful. We're making it visual and real-time.

Launching next Tuesday. Would you be interested in hunting it?

What makes it different:
- Built specifically for Claude Code (not generic PM tool)
- Bidirectional file sync (UI ↔ filesystem)
- Real-time updates with sub-200ms latency
- Open source, production-ready

Demo: [DEMO_URL]
GitHub: [GITHUB_URL]

Happy to share more details if you're interested. Thanks for considering!

[Name]
Founder, Generic Corp
[Twitter/LinkedIn]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges his PH founder status without being sycophantic
- Focuses on indie maker story (his passion)
- Strong "why it matters" narrative
- Shows traction (30+ beta users)
- Open source angle (he supports this)

**Follow-Up (If "Maybe"):**
```
Thanks for considering, Ryan!

A few more details that might help:

**Traction:**
- 30 beta users in private testing
- Launching on Show HN first (Tuesday) to validate positioning
- Active Discord community (50+ members)
- 250+ GitHub stars (organic)

**Why now:**
Claude Code just hit mainstream. Developers are building agent swarms but debugging tools haven't caught up. We're filling that gap.

**What we need from hunter:**
Just the network effect - your audience is exactly who needs this. We handle all the assets, support, and engagement.

Happy to hop on a quick call if that helps. No pressure either way!

## TIER 1 TARGET #3: Ben Tossell (@bentossell)

**Background Research:**
- No-code/AI tools specialist
- Focuses on: Automation, productivity, AI applications
- Recent hunts: AI automation tools, no-code platforms
- Active on: Twitter, communities
- Best approach: Twitter DM

**Personalized DM:**

**Subject:** AI debugging tool - built for developer audience

```
Hey Ben!

I know you focus on no-code and AI tools - saw your hunt of [recent product]. This is more technical, but thought it might interest you given the AI angle.

We built Claude Code Dashboard - a visual debugger for multi-agent AI workflows. It's for developers building with Claude's Agent SDK who need to see what their agents are doing in real-time.

The market: Every developer using Claude Code for agent orchestration (growing fast) currently debugs by tailing logs. We make it visual.

Would you be interested in hunting it next Tuesday?

What makes it unique:
- First tool built specifically for Claude Code ecosystem
- Real-time visual debugging (like Chrome DevTools for AI)
- Bidirectional sync between UI and filesystem
- Production-ready, open source

Demo: [DEMO_URL]
GitHub: [GITHUB_URL]

Totally understand if it's too technical for your audience - no worries if not a fit!

Cheers,
[Name]
[Twitter]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges his focus area upfront
- Explains why it might still fit (AI angle)
- Clear market positioning
- Gives him easy out if not a fit

**Follow-Up (If Interested):**
```
Amazing! Here's the full context:

**Target audience:** Developers building multi-agent AI systems with Claude Code

**Pain point:** Debugging agent failures is painful - no visibility into what agents are doing, why workflows fail, or how to diagnose issues

**Solution:** Real-time visual dashboard that shows agent status, task progress, and full event streams

**Why it's growing:** Claude Code just went mainstream. Developer need debugging tools to match.

**Hunter kit includes:**
- 5 high-res screenshots
- 60-sec demo video
- Product copy (optimized)
- I'll handle all engagement on launch day

Excited to work together! When works best for you to launch? We're flexible on timing.

## TIER 1 TARGET #4: Hiten Shah (@hnshah)

**Background Research:**
- SaaS and developer platform focus
- Focuses on: Product analytics, developer tools, B2B SaaS
- Recent hunts: Developer productivity tools, analytics platforms
- Active on: Twitter, writes thoughtful analysis
- Best approach: Twitter DM

**Personalized DM:**

**Subject:** Developer tool launch - Claude Code ecosystem

```
Hey Hiten!

I've been following your work in the developer tools space (your analysis on [specific blog post or tweet] was spot-on).

We're launching a visual debugger for Claude Code agent swarms next week and I'd love to have you hunt it.

The insight: Multi-agent AI systems are the new microservices - powerful but hard to debug. Just like how we needed better observability tools for distributed systems, we need them for agent orchestration.

Claude Code Dashboard gives developers real-time visibility into what their agents are doing, why workflows fail, and how to fix issues fast.

Early traction: 30+ beta users (ex-Google, Stripe, etc.) telling us this should be the standard for the ecosystem.

Interested in hunting it Tuesday?

Key features:
- Real-time agent workflow visualization
- Bidirectional file sync (UI ↔ filesystem)
- Sub-200ms WebSocket updates
- Production-grade reliability

Demo: [DEMO_URL]
GitHub: [GITHUB_URL]

Would love your thoughts!

Best,
[Name]
Founder, Generic Corp
```

**Why This Works:**
- References his analytical style
- Makes smart analogy (microservices → agents)
- Positions product in broader context
- Shows he'd understand the value

**Follow-Up (If He Asks Questions):**
```
Great questions! Here's more detail:

**Market size:** Every developer using Claude Code for agent orchestration. Growing fast as AI agents become standard in production systems.

**Why now:** Claude Code just hit mainstream adoption. Debugging tools haven't caught up. We're first to market with agent-specific debugging.

**Business model:** Open source core, will monetize with enterprise features (team collaboration, advanced analytics, self-hosted options). Think GitLab model.

**Differentiation from competitors:**
- Existing tools: Generic project management (Linear, Asana) - not built for agent speeds
- Our approach: Real-time sync optimized for agent workflows, filesystem integration, sub-200ms latency

**Why I think you'd be great hunter:**
Your audience is developer platform builders - exactly who needs this. Plus your analytical lens would help frame the problem correctly.

Happy to discuss more! Want to hop on a quick call?

Hey Francesco!

I've been following your hunts in the dev tools space - especially loved [recent hunt]. You have a great eye for tools that actually help developers ship faster.

I'm an indie maker who just built Claude Code Dashboard - a visual debugger for multi-agent AI systems.

The story: I was debugging agent swarms for a client project and spent hours tailing logs with no idea why workflows were failing. Built this dashboard to save my sanity. Now other developers are asking to use it.

Launching on Show HN this Tuesday, then Product Hunt the following Tuesday. Would you be interested in hunting it?

What it does:
- Shows real-time status of all agents in a swarm
- Visualizes task progress and failures
- Bidirectional sync with filesystem (edit anywhere, updates everywhere)
- Built with React, TypeScript, Socket.io - all open source

Demo: [DEMO_URL]
GitHub: [GITHUB_URL]

It's my first big launch as an indie maker - would be honored to have your support!

Cheers,

@[twitter_handle]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Indie maker to indie maker connection
- Personal story (relatable)
- Shows authenticity (first big launch)
- Technical stack details (he appreciates this)
- Open source (indie community values this)

**Follow-Up (If Positive Response):**
```
Thanks so much! Really excited to work together.

**Hunter kit coming your way:**
- 5 high-res screenshots (dashboard in action)
- 60-second demo video
- Product copy (tagline, description, talking points)
- Early access credentials

**Launch logistics:**
- Target date: Next Tuesday (one week after Show HN)
- Time: 5:00 AM PST (optimal for visibility)
- I'll be available all day for engagement

**What makes this hunt different:**
- Built by indie maker (me!) - authentic story
- Solving real problem I had while freelancing
- Open source from day one
- Active community already forming

Let me know if you need anything else! Really appreciate you considering it.

## SENDING STRATEGY (MONDAY)

### Timing
- **9:00 AM EST Monday:** Send all 5 DMs
- **Why:** Gives them full workday Monday to respond, we can coordinate Tuesday launch if quick yes
- **Spacing:** Send all within same hour (not spaced out)

### Tracking Responses
Create spreadsheet with:
- Hunter name
- DM sent timestamp
- Response received timestamp
- Response type (Yes/Maybe/No/No response)
- Follow-up sent timestamp
- Final status

### Response Prioritization

**If Multiple "Yes" Responses:**
1. Ryan Hoover (highest impact)
2. Chris Messina (second choice)
3. Hiten Shah (great fit)
4. Ben Tossell (good fit)
5. Francesco Di Lorenzo (authentic indie angle)

**If No "Yes" by Tuesday:**
- Move to Tier 2 hunters
- Or proceed with self-launch (totally acceptable)

### Monday Execution Checklist

**9:00 AM EST:**
- [ ] Replace [DEMO_URL] with real staging URL
- [ ] Replace [GITHUB_URL] with real repo URL
- [ ] Replace [Name] with founder's actual name
- [ ] Replace [Twitter/LinkedIn] with actual handles
- [ ] Send all 5 DMs
- [ ] Log send times in tracking spreadsheet

**Throughout Monday:**
- [ ] Check responses every 2 hours
- [ ] Respond to any replies within 30 minutes
- [ ] Send follow-ups to interested hunters immediately

**Monday Evening:**
- [ ] Assess responses
- [ ] If hunter secured → coordinate launch details
- [ ] If no hunter → prepare for self-launch (also fine!)
- [ ] Report status to marketing-manager-2

---

## BACKUP PLAN: SELF-LAUNCH

**If No Hunter by Monday EOD:**

Self-launching on Product Hunt is totally acceptable and often preferred by indie makers. Many successful products (#1 product of the day) launched without hunters.

**Advantages of Self-Launch:**
- Full control over timing and messaging
- More authentic founder story
- No coordination needed
- Can still be very successful

**How to Self-Launch:**
1. Use same assets prepared for hunter
2. Post at 5:00 AM PST Tuesday as maker
3. Engage heavily in comments (same strategy)
4. Rally community (Discord, Twitter) for support
5. Be authentic about being solo founder

**Examples of Successful Self-Launches:**
- Many #1 products were self-launched
- Community often rallies harder for solo founders
- More authentic story can actually help
