- **Capacity:** Confirm infrastructure can handle HN traffic spike

### With Engineering
- **Demo Stability:** Demo must be rock-solid before launch
- **Quick-Start:** `pnpm install && pnpm dev` must work on fresh machine
- **Health Check:** Endpoint returning 200 before posting

### With DevOps
- **CDN:** Cloudflare for DDoS protection during HN surge
- **Monitoring:** Alerts for demo downtime during launch window

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Show HN doesn't gain traction | Re-post 2-3 weeks later with different title |
| Demo goes down during launch | Health check before posting, backup URL ready |
| Negative HN comments | Response templates ready, acknowledge valid points |
| Product Hunt flops | Focus on GitHub/content, build case studies |
| Discord is quiet | Daily founder posts, engaging questions, voice chats |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set Show HN launch date** - Coordinate with Product on MVP readiness
2. **Begin hunter outreach** - marketing-2-2 starts today
3. **Publish first Dev.to article** - marketing-1-2, by T-7
4. **Launch Discord** - marketing-2-2, at T-7
5. **Create visual assets** - GIFs, screenshots, demo video
6. **Finalize README** - Badges, quick-start, architecture diagram
