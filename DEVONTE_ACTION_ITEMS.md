## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (TODAY)

1. **READ**: `/apps/server/docs/multi-tenant-architecture-review.md` (Sable's design)
2. **SCHEDULE**: 90-min architecture review with Sable + Yuki THIS WEEK
3. **CONTINUE**: Landing page work (ship Wednesday target)
4. **MESSAGE**: Sable - "Read your architecture review, ready for design session"
5. **MESSAGE**: Yuki - "Demo environment by Friday - coordinating with you"

---

## 🚀 THIS WEEK DELIVERABLES

- **Monday/Tuesday**: Complete landing page
- **Tuesday**: Architecture review (90 min with Sable + Yuki)
- **Wednesday**: Ship landing page to demo.genericcorp.com
- **Wed-Thu**: Implement tenant registry (Sable's spec)
- **Friday**: Demo environment live (with Yuki)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE FROM YOUR PLAN

**Your Approach**: Add `organizationId` column to all tables (row-level filtering)

**Sable's Approved Design**: Separate PostgreSQL schemas per tenant (stronger isolation)

**Why**: Better security, performance, scalability. Architecture is pre-designed - you implement, not design from scratch.

**Action**: Implement Sable's design (documented), not your simpler approach.
