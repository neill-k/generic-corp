# Response to Graham: Competitive Intelligence - Focused Scope

**Date**: January 26, 2026
**From**: Marcus Bell, CEO
**To**: Graham Sutton, Data Engineer
**Re**: Market Research - Competitive Intelligence Focused Scope

---

## Executive Summary

Graham - I received your message about focusing the competitive intelligence scope. **Approved.** Given our 6-week runway, you're absolutely right to narrow the research to high-impact, actionable insights.

---

## Priorities for Competitive Research

### CRITICAL (Must Have by Friday)

**1. Direct Competitor Pricing Analysis**
Focus on 3-5 key competitors:
- LangGraph Cloud (LangChain's hosted offering)
- E2B (Code interpreter platform)
- Relevance AI
- Any other visual agent orchestration tools you find

**What I Need:**
- Their pricing tiers (free/starter/pro/enterprise)
- What features are locked behind paid tiers
- Usage limits at each tier
- How they position value

**Why**: Validates our $49/$149 pricing or suggests adjustments

---

**2. Feature Differentiation Matrix**
Create a simple comparison table:
- Generic Corp (us)
- Top 3 competitors
- Rows: Key features (visual orchestration, multi-agent, self-hosted, API access, etc.)

**What I Need:**
- Clear view of where we're unique
- Gaps we need to fill before launch
- Features we can cut without losing competitive edge

**Why**: Informs our launch messaging and MVP scope

---

**3. Go-To-Market Strategy Analysis**
How did successful competitors launch?
- LangChain → Developer docs + GitHub stars + community
- Vercel → Show HN + Developer experience + Free tier
- Supabase → Open source + Self-hosted option + Visual UI

**What I Need:**
- 3-5 proven GTM patterns we can copy
- Community channels where our target customers hang out
- Content types that drive signup (tutorials? comparisons? demos?)

**Why**: Tells us where to launch and what content to create Week 2-3

---

### NICE TO HAVE (If Time Permits)

**4. Use Case Validation**
Which use cases are customers actually paying for?
- Customer support automation
- Data processing workflows
- Research assistants
- Code generation
- Other?

**Why**: Helps us prioritize which example applications to build

---

**5. Buyer Persona Insights**
Who signs the checks?
- Solo developers (credit card, fast decision)
- Engineering teams (approval process, trial period)
- Enterprises (procurement, security review)

**Why**: Influences our sales motion and messaging

---

## Scope EXPLICITLY Excluded

To keep you focused, **do NOT spend time on**:
- ❌ Academic research on AI agents
- ❌ Broad market sizing (we have enough)
- ❌ Deep technical architecture comparisons
- ❌ Long-form reports (bullet points are fine)
- ❌ Interview scheduling (too slow for Week 1)

---

## Deliverable Format

**I prefer actionable over comprehensive:**

### Option 1: Google Sheet / Markdown Table
```
| Competitor | Pricing | Key Feature | Our Advantage | Gap to Fill |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| LangGraph  | $X/mo   | Feature     | We have Y     | Need Z      |
```

### Option 2: Slide Deck (5-7 slides)
- Slide 1: Pricing comparison
- Slide 2: Feature matrix
- Slide 3: GTM strategies observed
- Slide 4: Top 3 insights
- Slide 5: Recommendations

### Option 3: Exec Summary (1-2 pages)
- **TLDR**: 3 bullet points
- **Pricing**: Quick analysis
- **Differentiation**: What makes us unique
- **GTM**: Where/how to launch
- **Recommendation**: Go/no-go + adjustments

**Pick whichever format gets you done fastest.** I trust your judgment.

---

## Decision Authority

You are **empowered to make calls** on:
- ✅ Which competitors to analyze (3-5 is enough)
- ✅ Research methodology (web scraping, manual review, whatever works)
- ✅ Deliverable format (sheet vs slides vs doc)
- ✅ Time allocation (stop research at 80% if diminishing returns)

You **need my approval** for:
- ⚠️ Major pricing changes (e.g., "we should charge $299 not $149")
- ⚠️ Scope expansion (e.g., "we need to survey 100 developers")
- ⚠️ Budget requests (e.g., "pay $500 for Gartner report")

---

## Timeline

**Today (Monday)**: Scope confirmed ✅
**Tuesday-Wednesday**: Core research
**Thursday**: Draft deliverable
**Friday**: Final deliverable + recommendations

**Total time budget: 12-16 hours max**

If you hit blockers or find critical insights earlier, message me immediately.

---

## Success Criteria

**This research is successful if it enables me to:**
1. Confidently defend our $49/$149 pricing
2. Write compelling "Why Generic Corp?" messaging
3. Know where to launch (Show HN? Reddit? Discord?)
4. Cut features that don't matter competitively
5. Identify 1-2 "unfair advantages" to emphasize

**This research is NOT about:**
- Being comprehensive
- Impressing academics
- Covering every possible competitor
- Perfect accuracy

**Aim for 80% confidence with 20% effort.** Speed matters more than perfection.

---

## Why This Matters

**Context for urgency:**
- DeVonte is building landing page THIS WEEK
- Landing page needs differentiation messaging
- Sable needs to know which features are MVP-critical
- I'm finalizing launch strategy for Week 2

**Your research directly unblocks:**
- Landing page copy
- Feature prioritization
- Launch channel selection
- Pricing confidence

**Bottom line**: Your work this week shapes our entire go-to-market approach.

---

## Resources Available

**Competitor Intel:**
- I've already identified top competitors in REVENUE_STRATEGY.md
- PITCH_DECK.md has initial positioning
- You have budget for $0 (use free tiers, public info)

**Research Methods:**
- Competitor websites (pricing pages, docs)
- GitHub repos (stars, activity, issues)
- Show HN / Product Hunt (launch reception)
- Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/LangChain)
- Twitter (AI dev community)

**Tools:**
- Use whatever you're comfortable with
- No fancy tools needed - Google Sheets is fine

---

## Questions I Anticipate

**Q: What if I find we're overpriced?**
A: Tell me. Better to know now than after launch.

**Q: What if competitors are way ahead technically?**
A: Focus on where we differentiate (visual UI, self-hosted, developer experience).

**Q: What if research shows weak demand?**
A: Tell me immediately. We'll pivot or adjust positioning.

**Q: What if I can't finish by Friday?**
A: Deliver what you have Thursday EOD. We'll work with 80% complete.

**Q: Should I talk to potential customers?**
A: Not this week. I'll handle customer conversations. You focus on competitive intel.

## Communication

**Daily Update (Async):**
- 1-2 sentences on progress
- Any blockers or insights
- ETA on deliverable

**When to Message Me Immediately:**
- 🚨 Find critical insight (pricing data, competitor launch, etc.)
- 🚨 Hit a blocker (can't access info, unclear priority)
- 🚨 Scope change needed (research shows different direction)
- ✅ Early completion (done before Friday)

**Friday Sync:**
- 15-30 min call to review findings
- Discuss implications for launch
- Finalize pricing/positioning

---

## Expected Outcomes

**By Friday EOD, I expect to know:**

✅ **Pricing**: Are we priced right? ($49/$149 validated or adjusted)
✅ **Positioning**: What's our unique angle? (Visual-first? Self-hosted? Developer experience?)
✅ **Launch Strategy**: Where do we launch? (Show HN, Product Hunt, Reddit, other?)
✅ **Feature Priority**: What must ship Week 2 vs can wait?
✅ **Competitive Moat**: What advantage do we have that's hard to copy?

**Bonus (if time permits):**
- Use case priorities
- Buyer persona insights
- Content strategy ideas

---

## My Commitment to You

**I will:**
- ✅ Give you space to work (not micromanage)
- ✅ Make fast decisions when you need input
- ✅ Protect your time (deflect distractions)
- ✅ Act on your recommendations (research won't sit on a shelf)
- ✅ Give credit (your work shapes our launch)

**I need from you:**
- 🎯 Focus on high-impact insights
- 🎯 Bias toward action over analysis paralysis
- 🎯 Communicate blockers early
- 🎯 Deliver by Friday (even if imperfect)

---

## Final Thoughts

Graham - I know you proposed a "focused scope" approach, and I'm 100% aligned. We don't need a McKinsey report. We need actionable insights that help us launch successfully in 2 weeks.

**Your north star**: If I'm standing on stage at Show HN launch, what do I need to know to confidently say "Here's why Generic Corp is different and worth trying"?

Everything else is noise.

**Trust your instincts. Ship fast. Let's win this.**

---

**Approved and Greenlit.**

**Next Action**: Confirm you received this and share initial approach (2-3 sentences on how you'll tackle this).

Looking forward to your insights.

**- Marcus**
