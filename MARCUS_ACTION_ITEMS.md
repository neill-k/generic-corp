## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk: Domain/Stripe delays
**Status**: Handling today to minimize delay
**Mitigation**: Starting both processes immediately

### Risk: Team coordination overhead
**Status**: Clear ownership assigned
**Mitigation**: Daily async updates, fast decision-making

### Risk: Technical blockers (auth, multi-tenancy)
**Status**: Sable reviewing architecture
**Mitigation**: Expert review before implementation

### Risk: Market doesn't want this
**Status**: Uncertain (no validation yet)
**Mitigation**: 10 user interviews this week + beta program

### Risk: Timeline too aggressive
**Status**: High risk given scope
**Mitigation**:
- Cut scope if needed (no demo env, minimal docs)
- Launch with waitlist if not ready
- Iterate post-launch

---

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Daily Standups (Async)
- Format: Slack message EOD
- Content: Progress, blockers, needs
- Response time: <1hr for blockers

### Weekly All-Hands
- Format: 30-min video call (Fridays)
- Agenda: Wins, learnings, next week priorities
- Recording: Share for those who can't attend

### Decision-Making
- Minor: Team leads decide, inform Marcus
- Major: Marcus decides within 24hrs
- Critical: Discuss synchronously, decide same day

---

## BUDGET TRACKING

### Monthly Burn (Pre-Revenue)
- Domain: $1-2/mo (annual subscription)
- Clerk: $25-99/mo (start with free tier)
- Vercel: $20/mo (Pro plan)
- Monitoring: $20-50/mo (Sentry + analytics)
- **Total**: ~$66-171/mo

### Breakeven Point
- Need: 2-4 Starter tier users ($98-196/mo)
- OR: 1-2 Pro tier users ($149-298/mo)
- Target: 5 paid users by end of Week 3

### Revenue Target (Month 1)
- Conservative: 10 users × $49 = $490/mo

## NOTES

- **Philosophy**: Ship fast, iterate faster. Perfect is the enemy of done.
- **Priority**: Revenue > Features. If it doesn't drive signups/conversions, it's not P0.
- **Team First**: Support the team, remove blockers, celebrate wins.
- **Transparency**: Share progress publicly (within team), own failures quickly.
