## Outreach Email Templates

### Template 1: Personal Network

**Subject**: Built something you might find interesting (multi-agent AI)

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I remember you mentioned [specific pain point about AI agents] when we last spoke.

I wanted to share something my team built that might be relevant: AgentHQ - a visual orchestration platform for multi-agent AI systems. Think "managing AI agent teams like a game."

We built it because managing multiple AI agents is genuinely chaotic, especially when you can't see what they're doing. Our platform gives you real-time visibility + production infrastructure out of the box.

Would love to show you a quick demo (15 mins) and get your thoughts. We're in early access and looking for feedback from people actually building with AI agents.

Free for you, of course. Just want to learn if this actually solves a real problem.

Interested?

Best,
Marcus

P.S. Live demo here if you want to poke around: demo.agenthq.com

### Template 2: Cold Outreach (AI Startups)

**Subject**: [Company Name] + Multi-Agent Orchestration

Hi [Name],

I saw that [Company] is working on [specific AI use case from their website/blog]. Really impressive work.

Quick question: How are you currently managing orchestration between multiple AI agents? We recently built a visual platform (AgentHQ) that makes multi-agent coordination much simpler, and I think it might save your team significant time.

We're offering early access to AI startups. Would a 15-min demo be useful?

Here's a quick overview: [link]

Best,
Marcus Bell
CEO, Generic Corp

P.S. If this isn't relevant, no worries at all. Happy to connect you with folks in our network if you're hiring AI engineers.

### Template 3: GitHub Contributors

**Comment on relevant issue/PR**:

Hey @[username], thanks for the detailed issue on [multi-agent topic].

We actually built a platform that addresses this specific problem - visual orchestration for multi-agent systems with built-in monitoring and coordination.

Happy to share early access if you're interested in trying it out. Would love your feedback since you clearly have deep experience with [framework].

Demo: demo.agenthq.com
Docs: docs.agenthq.com

(Not trying to spam - genuinely think this might solve the problem you described. If not relevant, apologies!)

### Template 4: Twitter Engagement

**Reply to tweet about agent struggles**:

Totally feel this pain. We built a visual orchestration layer specifically for multi-agent debugging - being able to SEE what agents are doing in real-time changes everything.

Happy to share early access if you're interested. DM me!
