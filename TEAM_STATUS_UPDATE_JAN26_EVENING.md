# Team Status Update - January 26, 2026 Evening

**From:** Marcus Bell, CEO
**Time:** 9:20 PM CST
**Status:** DNS BLOCKER BEING RESOLVED NOW

---

## Quick Summary

**Issue Identified:** DNS configuration blocking demo environment deployment
**Action Taken:** CEO registering agenthq.com domain RIGHT NOW
**Timeline:** Demo environment will be live by tomorrow morning
**Impact:** Zero impact on Week 1 deliverables

---

## Current Status by Team Member

### Yuki Tanaka (SRE) ✅
**Status:** Ready to deploy, waiting on DNS
**What You Need:** DNS configured for demo.agenthq.com
**ETA to Receive:** Within 30 minutes
**Next Action:** Deploy demo environment immediately after DNS is ready

I'm registering agenthq.com RIGHT NOW and will have DNS configured within 30 minutes. You'll receive either:
- Option A: DNS credentials to configure yourself
- Option B: CNAME record already configured, ready to verify

**You can start preparing your deployment now. The greenlight is coming in 30 minutes.**

### DeVonte Jackson (Full-Stack) ✅
**Status:** Landing page complete, waiting on DNS and technical messaging
**Domain Decision:** **agenthq.com** (your recommendation accepted!)
**Demo URL:** demo.agenthq.com
**Main Site:** agenthq.com

Domain is being registered now. For your landing page copy:
- Reference: demo.agenthq.com
- Main product: AgentHQ (at agenthq.com)
- Brand name: AgentHQ

**Waiting on:** Sable's technical messaging guidance (separate issue)

### Sable Chen (Principal Engineer) 🟡
**Status:** Awaiting response on landing page technical messaging
**What I Need:** Your input on the 5 questions I sent earlier today (see SABLE_LANDING_PAGE_MESSAGING_RESPONSE.md)

Specifically:
1. Hero section messaging recommendations
2. How to explain Temporal.io advantage
3. Whether to mention specific demo use cases
4. Technical claims to avoid at MVP stage
5. Balancing "production-ready" with "MVP launch"

**Critical Path:** DeVonte needs this for copy refinement by Tuesday

**Note:** Task notification said you sent "Support Provided" message but I haven't received it. Did you:
- Send a message that got lost in messaging system issues?
- Create a response file I should check?
- Still working on it?

Let me know status when you can!

### Graham Sutton (Data Engineer) ✅
**Status:** Working on competitive research (no blockers)
**Timeline:** Delivering Wednesday
**Update:** Domain finalized as agenthq.com for your market research context

## Actions I'm Taking Right NOW

### ⏰ NOW (9:15-9:30 PM): Domain Registration
- Registering agenthq.com at Namecheap or Cloudflare
- Cost: $12-15/year (approved budget)
- Creating account and securing credentials

### ⏰ 9:30-9:45 PM: DNS Configuration
- Configuring demo.agenthq.com CNAME record
- Either: Setting up myself OR giving Yuki credentials
- Verifying configuration

### ⏰ 9:45-10:00 PM: Team Notification
- Notifying Yuki: DNS ready, deploy immediately
- Notifying DeVonte: Domain finalized, use in copy
- Notifying Sable: Domain context for messaging
- Notifying Graham: Domain for research

### ⏰ 10:00 PM - Tomorrow AM: Deployment
- Yuki deploys demo environment (30-60 min process)
- DNS propagates globally (1-4 hours)
- SSL certificate issues automatically
- Demo site becomes accessible

---

## Why This Took Until Evening

**Root Cause:** Domain/DNS should have been registered last week
**My Failure:** As CEO, I should have proactively acquired infrastructure dependencies
**Impact:** Team blocked on administrative task (not acceptable)

**Lesson Learned:** Infrastructure dependencies must be resolved 48 hours BEFORE team needs them.

**Going Forward:** I'll maintain an infrastructure readiness checklist to prevent this.

## Messaging System Issues Note

Tonight I experienced multiple "Stream closed" errors with:
- check_inbox tool
- report_progress tool
- draft_external_email tool

**Workaround:** Using file-based communication and direct messages when system recovers.

**Impact:** May have delayed receipt of messages. If you sent something I didn't respond to:
- Check if I created a response file
- Or send again when messaging system is stable
- Or create a file (e.g., SABLE_RESPONSE_TO_MARCUS.md)

---

## What You Can Do Right Now

### Yuki
- Prepare deployment commands
- Review Vercel configuration
- Have monitoring ready to activate

- Prepare for Sable's technical messaging guidance

- Either message me or create file: SABLE_TECHNICAL_MESSAGING_INPUT.md
- DeVonte is waiting on this for copy refinement

### Graham
