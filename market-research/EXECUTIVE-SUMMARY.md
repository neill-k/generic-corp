# DaaS Market Research - Executive Summary
**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Prepared by:** Graham Sutton, Data Engineer
**Status:** Initial research complete, ready for customer validation

---

## Quick Decision Framework

### ✅ GO Recommendation: Pursue DaaS/ETL Opportunity

**Why:**
- $50.6B market growing 28-37% annually
- Clear underserved segment (SMBs priced out by Fivetran, intimidated by Airbyte)
- Validated pain point (data silos, metric fragmentation)
- Achievable MVP in 3-4 weeks
- Path to $1K-3K MRR in 6 weeks

---

## The One-Pager

**MARKET:** $50.6B Data-as-a-Service market, SME segment growing fastest (18.7% CAGR)

**PROBLEM:** SMBs use 3+ disconnected SaaS tools, waste time on metric debates, can't afford $5K+/month enterprise solutions

**SOLUTION:** Affordable managed ETL platform ($299-999/month) that unifies data sources without requiring engineering expertise

**TARGET:** RevOps/Analytics leaders at 10-100 person SaaS companies

**COMPETITION:**
- Fivetran = too expensive ($500-1,067/M rows)
- Airbyte = too technical (requires self-hosting)
- Us = affordable + managed + vertical focus

**DIFFERENTIATION:** Vertical specialization (e.g., "ETL for B2B SaaS") with AI-enhanced data quality and pre-built dashboards

**MVP:** 5-7 core connectors (Stripe, HubSpot, Mixpanel, GA, Meta Ads) + data warehouse destinations

**GTM:** Founder-led outbound + free 90-day pilots + PLG free tier

**6-WEEK GOALS:**
- 15+ customer discovery interviews
- 3-5 pilot customers secured
- MVP launched
- $1K-3K MRR

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Vertical Focus:** B2B SaaS, DTC E-commerce, or Digital Agencies?
   - Recommendation: B2B SaaS (fastest validation, network effects)

2. **Customer Discovery:** Approve 15 interviews this week?
   - Critical for validating pricing and feature priorities

3. **Team Coordination:** DeVonte ready to build frontend/API
   - Need to align on data architecture after validation

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Competitive response | Vertical focus creates moat |
| Technical complexity | Start with 5-10 connectors, leverage open-source |
| High CAC | PLG free tier + founder-led sales |
| Market saturation | Be "Fivetran for X" not generic platform |

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. ✅ **DONE:** Market research (this document)
2. **PENDING:** Get approval from Marcus
3. **NEXT:** Customer discovery interviews (15 prospects)
4. **THEN:** Refine MVP scope based on feedback
5. **FINALLY:** Kick off build with DeVonte
