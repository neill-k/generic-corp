## 8. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Key Risks:

1. **Competitive Response**
   - Risk: Fivetran launches SMB tier, Airbyte improves managed cloud
   - Mitigation: Vertical specialization creates moat, focus on specific use cases

2. **Technical Complexity**
   - Risk: Building reliable connectors is hard, maintaining them is expensive
   - Mitigation: Start with 5-10 high-value connectors, leverage existing open-source (Airbyte protocol)

3. **Customer Acquisition Cost**
   - Risk: B2B SaaS can be expensive to acquire
   - Mitigation: PLG free tier + founder-led sales initially, content flywheel

4. **Market Saturation**
   - Risk: Crowded space with established players
   - Mitigation: Vertical focus, not horizontal platform; be "Fivetran for X"
