## Risks & Concerns

### Immediate
1. **Messaging System**: Technical issues preventing team communication
   - **Mitigation**: Using file-based communication temporarily
   - **Impact**: Low (workaround effective)

2. **Deployment Timing**: Need DeVonte to deploy today for maximum Week 1 impact
   - **Mitigation**: Clear priority communicated, no technical blockers
   - **Impact**: Medium (delays reduce Week 1 effectiveness)

### Short-term
1. **Sable Response Time**: Awaiting architecture decisions
   - **Mitigation**: 24-hour escalation planned if no response
   - **Impact**: Low (others can proceed independently)

2. **Email Integration**: Needs backend service choice
   - **Mitigation**: Recommended ConvertKit, can set up account
   - **Impact**: Low (not blocking deployment)
