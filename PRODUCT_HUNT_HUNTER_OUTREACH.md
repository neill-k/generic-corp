- **Approach:** Twitter DM
- **Likelihood:** Low (very busy) but worth trying

**2. Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover)**
- **Why:** PH founder, still does select hunts
- **Recent Hunts:** Indie dev tools

### Tier 2 Targets (Reach Out TOMORROW if Tier 1 doesn't respond)

**Research Required:**
- Search Product Hunt for recent "developer tools" hunts
- Filter by hunters with 5k+ followers
- Check their hunt frequency (not too often = more selective)
- Look for hunters who engage in comments (shows genuine interest)

**How to Find:**
1. Go to producthunt.com
2. Search "developer tools" or "AI tools"
3. Filter by "Last Month"
4. Note hunters of top products
5. Check their PH profiles for hunt history
6. Prioritize those with 10+ successful hunts

---

## Outreach Strategy

### Research Before Reaching Out (15 min per hunter)
- [ ] Check their recent Twitter activity
- [ ] Read their last 3 PH hunts
- [ ] Note what they care about (themes, causes)
- [ ] Find personal connection if possible
- [ ] Review their website/bio

### DM Template - Version 1 (Personal Connection)

**Subject:** Quick question about hunting a dev tool

```
Hey [Name]!

I loved your hunt of [recent product they hunted] - [specific thing you noticed: their description was great / good questions in comments / etc].

I'm launching a visual debugger for Claude Code agent swarms next Tuesday (week after our Show HN launch this Tuesday). It's getting great early feedback from developers debugging multi-agent systems.

Would you be interested in hunting it? Happy to share early access and a quick demo.

Here's a 30-sec demo: [Loom link when available]

Key differentiators:
- First dashboard built for Claude Code specifically
- Real-time bidirectional sync (UI ↔ filesystem)
- Sub-200ms WebSocket latency for agent coordination

No worries if your schedule is full - totally understand!

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title]

```

### DM Template - Version 2 (Cold but Valuable)

**Subject:** Developer tool launch - looking for hunter

```
Hey [Name]!

I've been following your hunts and love your focus on [developer tools / AI tools / etc].

Quick pitch: We built a real-time visual debugger for Claude Code agent swarms. Think Chrome DevTools but for AI orchestration.

Launching next Tuesday and looking for a hunter who understands the developer workflow space. Early users (ex-Google/Stripe engineers) are loving it for debugging multi-agent systems.

Would you be interested? Here's what makes it different:
- Bidirectional file sync (edit in UI or filesystem)
- Real-time WebSocket updates (< 200ms)
- Built specifically for Claude Code (not generic PM tool)

30-sec demo: [Loom link]
GitHub: [link]

Happy to share more details if you're interested!

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]
```

### DM Template - Version 3 (If they ask for more info)

```
Awesome! Here's more context:

**What it does:**
Visual dashboard for Claude Code agent swarms with real-time task tracking, agent status, and bidirectional sync between UI and filesystem.

**Who it's for:**
Developers building multi-agent AI systems who need visibility into what their agents are doing, especially when debugging failures.

**Traction so far:**
- Private beta with 30 users
- Positive feedback from ex-FAANG engineers
- Show HN launch this Tuesday (testing positioning)
- 250+ GitHub stars (organic)

**Why it matters:**
First developer tool built specifically for Claude Code ecosystem. Most devs are debugging agent swarms by tailing logs - we give them real-time visual debugging instead.

**Launch plan:**
- Product Hunt: Next Tuesday (5:00 AM PST)
- Assets ready: screenshots, video, description
- Support team ready for questions
- Post-launch: Discord community, ongoing development

**Hunter kit includes:**
- Gallery images (5 high-res screenshots)
- 60-sec demo video
- Product description (optimized)
- Talking points
- Early access for testing

Want to hop on a quick call to see the demo live? Or happy to send you full hunter kit via email.

Thanks!

A: Currently optimized for Claude Code. Open to supporting other frameworks based on community interest.

Q: What's the tech stack?
A: TypeScript, React, Phaser 3, Express, Socket.io, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis.

Q: Is it production-ready?
A: Yes - we use it in production. It's v0.x so expect some rough edges, but core features are stable.

## Backup Plan (If No Hunter by Day 3)

### Option 1: Self-Launch (Acceptable)
- You can launch without a hunter
- Your account becomes the "maker"
- Actually preferred by some founders (more authentic)
- Can still be very successful

**Advantages:**
- Full control over timing
- Authentic founder story
- No coordination needed

**Disadvantages:**
- Less initial visibility (no hunter network)
- Have to build credibility yourself

### Option 2: Continue Hunter Search
- Expand to Tier 3 (up-and-coming hunters)
- Look for hunters with 1k-5k followers
- May have more availability
- Still valuable for network

### Option 3: Delay Launch
- If really want a specific hunter
- Push PH launch by 1 week
- Use extra time for polish
- Risk: Losing momentum from Show HN

**Recommendation:** Self-launch is fine! Many successful products launch without hunters. Focus on having a great product and engaging in comments.
