**The Rule of 10:1**
- For every 1 mention of our project, provide 10 genuinely helpful contributions
- Answer questions, share knowledge, help debug - without mentioning our tool
- Build reputation as domain expert first, then people will find our project naturally

### Reddit Engagement Strategy

   - Don'ts: Overhype or make unrealistic claims
   - Frequency: 1x every 2 weeks (Sat)
   - **Note:** This is the ONLY subreddit where promotional posts are acceptable

**Reddit Engagement Guidelines:**

**DO:**
- Read subreddit rules before posting
- Use relevant flair (e.g., [Discussion], [Help], [Show HN])
- Respond to every comment on your posts within 24 hours
- Upvote helpful comments, even if they're critical
- Edit posts to add updates based on feedback
- Link to specific GitHub files, not just homepage
- Acknowledge when you're the author/creator
- Provide context before linking (never bare URLs)

**DON'T:**
- Cross-post the same content to multiple subreddits in one day
- Delete posts if they don't perform well (builds distrust)
- Argue with critics (respond professionally or ignore)
- Use clickbait titles ("This ONE trick...")
- Post during low-traffic hours (avoid 2-6 AM EST)
- Link to landing pages in technical discussions (GitHub only)
- Use alt accounts to upvote/comment (ban risk)
- Promote in subreddit comments unless directly relevant

**Optimal Posting Times (EST):**
- Weekdays: 8-10 AM or 1-3 PM
- Weekends: 10 AM - 2 PM

### Stack Overflow / GitHub Discussions

**Stack Overflow Strategy:**

   - "agent orchestration frameworks"
   - "real-time websocket dashboard"
   - "Prisma multi-tenant"
   - Tags: `claude-ai`, `langchain`, `agents`, `websocket`

2. **Answer Format:**
   - Provide complete, working code examples
   - Explain the why, not just the what
   - Link to our GitHub repo as "here's a full implementation example"
   - Never say "use my tool" - say "here's how to solve this"

3. **Frequency:** 2-3 answers per week

4. **Profile Optimization:**
   - Bio: "Full-stack developer building agent orchestration tools"
   - GitHub link in profile
   - Focus on quality over quantity (aim for upvoted answers)

**GitHub Discussions Strategy:**

**Target Repos:**
- `langchain-ai/langchain` (80K stars)
- `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python` (1.5K stars)
- `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript` (1K stars)
- `crewAIInc/crewAI` (15K stars)

**Engagement Tactics:**
1. **Answer "Help Wanted" discussions**
   - Provide debugging tips
   - Link to our codebase as reference implementation

2. **Participate in feature requests**
   - "We implemented something similar in [our project]..."
   - Offer code snippets, architecture insights

3. **Share learnings in "Show and Tell"**
   - "Here's how we solved [problem] using [their library]"
   - Always position as complementary, never competitive

4. **Frequency:** 1-2 contributions per week

### Hacker News Strategy

**Submission Strategy:**
- **Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST (highest engagement)

3. Week 6: Technical blog post (if it's trending on Dev.to)
4. Week 8: Retrospective post ("Lessons from 8 weeks building...")

**Comment Strategy:**
- Comment on related submissions (AI agents, developer tools, debugging)
- Provide thoughtful technical insights
- **Never promote in comments** unless directly asked
- Frequency: 3-5 comments per week

**HN Etiquette:**
- No self-promotion in comments
- Disclose if you're the creator when commenting on your own post
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Respond to technical questions substantively
- Don't ask for upvotes (ban risk)

### Discord / Slack Communities
