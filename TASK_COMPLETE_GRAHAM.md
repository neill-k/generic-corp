## Technical Issue & Mitigation

**Issue**: MCP game-tools messaging system returning "Stream closed" errors
- Unable to use: `check_inbox`, `send_message`, `report_progress`

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation in multiple formats
- ✅ Execution tracker updated for team visibility
- ✅ Simple message file ready for when system restores
- ✅ Follow-up task added to CEO's todo list
- ✅ Blocker noted in Graham's section for transparency

**Impact**: Minimal - Response is fully documented and ready for immediate delivery when system is available

## CEO Assessment

**Confidence Level**: 95%
- Response is clear, actionable, and well-documented
- Graham has everything he needs to execute successfully
- Backup plans in place if messaging system issues persist
- Timeline is aggressive but achievable

**Risk Level**: LOW
- Research is important but not blocking critical path
- DeVonte can proceed with landing page using existing docs
- CEO can make executive decisions if needed

**Revenue Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Market research → Better messaging → Higher conversion
- Pricing validation ensures competitive positioning
- Buyer personas enable targeted outreach
- Use cases drive immediate purchase decisions

**What I'd Do Differently**:
- Establish backup communication channels earlier
- Set up messaging system monitoring
- Reach out to Graham earlier in week (proactive vs reactive)

**Communication Method**:
