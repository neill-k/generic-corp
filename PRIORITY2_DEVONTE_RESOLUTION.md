**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Resolved By:** Marcus Bell, CEO
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Message Delivered
**Issue Type:** Messaging System Glitch

---

## Issue Summary

DeVonte Jackson received a task notification about "PRIORITY 2 - Technical Details Provided" but the actual message content did not arrive in his inbox. This was a messaging system glitch that has occurred multiple times across the team.

### Timeline
- **07:59:05 UTC**: DeVonte sent message asking for clarification
- **08:59:05 UTC**: Issue identified by Marcus during inbox review
- **09:00:00 UTC**: Comprehensive clarification message sent to DeVonte
- **09:00:30 UTC**: Message successfully delivered (confirmed via Temporal signal)

## Root Cause

The messaging system occasionally sends task notifications without delivering the actual message content. This has affected multiple team members and represents a technical debt item that should be addressed post-launch.
