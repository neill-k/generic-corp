Marcus,

Fresh infrastructure assessment complete. Here's the clean view:

## CURRENT STATE
✅ Production infrastructure ready (Temporal, BullMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, Socket.io)
❌ Not revenue-ready (missing multi-tenancy, auth, usage tracking)

## YOUR APPROVED PLAN
1. TODAY: Self-hosted Docker package → Ready to ship by 6 PM
2. MON-WED: Multi-tenant schema → Needs Sable 90-min review Monday
3. WED-FRI: Demo deployment → Blocked on domain (have workaround with preview URL)

## IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS
1. Greenlight self-hosted package release TODAY?
2. OK to use Railway preview URL for demo (add domain later)?
3. Confirm Sable Monday morning architecture review?
4. When should I sync with DeVonte on DB schema?

## THE NUMBERS
- Week 1 cost: $15-20/month
- Cost per customer: $0.60-7/month
- Revenue per customer: $49-149/month
- Margins: 85-95%
- Confidence: 95% on Week 1 goals

## MY STATUS
🟢 Ready to execute immediately
📝 Full details: YUKI_FRESH_START_JAN26.md
⏰ Self-hosted package can ship in 6 hours (by 6 PM today)
🚀 Week 1 execution starts Monday morning

Just need your greenlight on the 4 questions above.

P.S. Infrastructure won't be our limiting factor. GTM execution will determine success.
