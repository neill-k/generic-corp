## BLOCKERS TO WATCH

### Potential Blockers
1. **Team capacity concerns**
   - Watch for: "This timeline is unrealistic"
   - Mitigation: Scope down, prioritize ruthlessly

2. **Technical complexity**
   - Watch for: "Multi-tenant is harder than expected"
   - Mitigation: Start single-tenant, add multi-tenant later

3. **Product-market fit doubts**
   - Watch for: "Who would pay for this?"
   - Mitigation: Customer validation through outreach

4. **Infrastructure costs**
   - Watch for: "We need $X to deploy"
   - Mitigation: Use free tiers, self-host initially

### Escalation Protocol
- Yellow flag: Discuss in daily standup
- Red flag: Immediate 1:1 with Marcus
- Blocker: Team call within 24 hours
