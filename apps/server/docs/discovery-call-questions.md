## The 5 Core Discovery Questions

### 1. Current State & Usage Assessment

**Primary Question:**
> "Can you walk me through how your engineering team is currently using AI coding tools? What tools are you using, how many developers, and roughly what's your monthly spend?"

**Follow-up Probes:**
- Which specific AI tools? (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, other?)
- How long have you been using them?
- What percentage of your team has adopted AI tools?
- Are you on individual plans or team/business plans?
- Do you know your current monthly cost? (If not, help estimate)

**What We're Learning:**
- ✅ Usage scale (qualifying criterion)
- ✅ Current spend (ROI calculation baseline)
- ✅ Tool sophistication (technical maturity)
- ✅ Procurement model (buying process indicator)

**Qualification Bar:**
- **Green**: 30+ devs using AI tools, $3K+/month spend
- **Yellow**: 10-30 devs, $1K-$3K/month spend
- **Red**: <10 devs or <$1K/month spend

### 2. Pain Point Identification

**Primary Question:**
> "What are the biggest challenges or frustrations you're experiencing with your current AI tool setup? What keeps you up at night related to AI tools?"

**Follow-up Probes:**
- Are costs growing faster than you expected?
- Have you experienced any outages or reliability issues?
- How do you feel about being dependent on a single vendor?
- Do you have visibility into who's using what and how much?
- Are different types of tasks better suited to different AI models?

**What We're Learning:**
- ✅ Primary pain point (cost vs. vendor lock-in vs. performance)
- ✅ Urgency level (is this a burning problem or nice-to-have?)
- ✅ Decision trigger (what would make them switch?)
- ✅ Internal stakeholder concerns (CFO pressure, CTO priorities)

**Strong Signal Phrases:**
- "Our CFO is asking us to justify the cost"
- "We're worried about vendor lock-in"
- "Costs are getting out of control"
- "We've been hit by API rate limits"
- "Different models are better for different tasks"

### 3. Decision Process & Timeline

**Primary Question:**
> "If you found a solution that could cut your AI costs by 40-50% while giving you multi-provider flexibility, what would your evaluation and decision process look like?"

**Follow-up Probes:**
- Who would need to be involved in evaluating this?
- What's your typical procurement process for dev tools?
- Do you do pilots or POCs before committing?
- What would success look like in a trial period?
- When are you planning your next budget cycle?
- How quickly could you make a decision if the ROI was clear?

**What We're Learning:**
- ✅ Decision makers (technical champion vs. economic buyer)
- ✅ Sales cycle length (days vs. weeks vs. months)
- ✅ Procurement complexity (simple approval vs. RFP)
- ✅ Budget timing (can they buy now or need to wait?)
- ✅ Evaluation criteria (what matters most?)

**Ideal Responses:**
- "I can make this decision with my CTO"
- "We typically do a 2-4 week pilot"
- "If the ROI is clear, we can move in 30 days"
- "We're actively looking to optimize costs this quarter"

**Red Flags:**
- "We'd need to go through a 6-month RFP process"
- "We just committed to a 2-year contract with [vendor]"
- "We're not looking to change anything this year"
- "I'd need to convince 10 stakeholders"

### 4. Technical Integration & Adoption

**Primary Question:**
> "How important is ease of integration and minimal disruption to your team's workflow? What would an ideal transition look like?"

**Follow-up Probes:**
- How do developers currently access AI tools? (IDE plugins, web, API)
- Do you have specific IDE requirements? (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
- How technically savvy is your team with trying new tools?
- Do you have DevOps/platform team that manages tool rollouts?
- What's your tolerance for setup complexity?
- Have you integrated other dev tools recently? How did it go?

**What We're Learning:**
- ✅ Technical requirements (IDE support, SSO, etc.)
- ✅ Integration effort tolerance (5 minutes vs. 5 days)
- ✅ Change management capability (top-down vs. grassroots)
- ✅ Platform team maturity (self-service vs. managed)
- ✅ Potential blockers (compliance, security, architecture)

**What We Should Communicate:**
- "Drop-in replacement for existing tools"
- "10-minute setup, no code changes required"
- "Transparent to developers - just works better"
- "We handle the complexity of multi-provider routing"

### 5. Value & ROI Qualification

**Primary Question:**
> "If we could show you concrete data that switching to our platform would save you $X per month with better performance and zero vendor lock-in, how meaningful would that be to your organization?"

**Follow-up Probes:**
- What ROI or payback period would make this a no-brainer?
- Are you more motivated by cost savings, risk mitigation, or performance?
- Would analytics and visibility into AI usage be valuable?
- How do you currently measure developer productivity?
- Would you be interested in seeing a customized ROI calculation?

**What We're Learning:**
- ✅ Value drivers (cost vs. risk vs. quality vs. control)
- ✅ ROI expectations (what's compelling?)
- ✅ Budget authority (can they spend to save?)
- ✅ Metrics sophistication (do they measure dev productivity?)
- ✅ Interest level (genuinely excited or just exploring?)

**Closing Techniques:**
- "Based on your numbers, I estimate you'd save $X/month"
- "Would you like me to prepare a detailed ROI analysis?"
- "Can I show you our cost savings dashboard with your data?"
- "We have a beta program with 50% off for 3 months - interested?"

## Objection Handling Guide

### "We're happy with our current solution"
**Response:**
> "That's great to hear! Out of curiosity, are you tracking your monthly costs and seeing that trend? Most teams we work with were happy too, until they realized they were spending 2-3x more than necessary. Would you be open to a quick cost analysis, no strings attached?"

### "We don't have budget for new tools"
**Response:**
> "I totally understand. The good news is this isn't a new budget line item - we're helping you reduce an existing expense. If your current AI tools cost $10K/month, and we can get that down to $6K/month, our platform pays for itself and then some. Would it help to see the actual numbers?"

### "We're locked into a contract"
**Response:**
> "That makes sense. When does your contract renew? Even if you can't switch immediately, many teams use our platform to understand their actual usage and costs to negotiate better rates when renewal comes up. Would a free analytics pilot be valuable in the meantime?"

### "We need to focus on other priorities"
**Response:**
> "I completely understand - you're busy shipping product. Here's the thing: our platform takes about 10 minutes to set up and then runs automatically. You don't need to think about it, and you'll save [specific dollar amount] per month. Is there ever a bad time to save money with almost zero effort?"

### "Sounds complicated to integrate"
**Response:**
> "Great question - this is actually our sweet spot. It's a drop-in replacement for your existing tools. Your developers don't change anything about their workflow. We handle all the complexity of routing between providers behind the scenes. We've had teams up and running in a single afternoon."
