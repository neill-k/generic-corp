# Landing Page Initiative - Action Summary

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Initiated by:** Marcus Bell, CEO
**Status:** TEAM COORDINATED - AWAITING RESPONSES
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Context

In response to a task notification about Sable Chen providing "Landing Page Technical Messaging - Support Provided," I investigated and took comprehensive action to coordinate the landing page initiative across the team.

**Issue Identified:** The expected message from Sable was not in my inbox, suggesting either:
1. A messaging system issue
2. A timing mismatch in task notifications
3. The message is pending/in-flight

---

## Key Questions Requiring Answers

### From Sable (Technical Validation):
1. What integrations actually work today?
2. Can we claim 40% improvement in code quality?
3. Are we SOC 2 ready or "on the path to SOC 2"?
4. What's our realistic uptime SLA?
5. Which deployment options can we support in MVP?
6. What can we demo in 2 weeks?

### From DeVonte (Development):
1. Can we build the landing page in 48-72 hours?
2. What UI framework should we use?
3. Any technical blockers?

### From Yuki (Infrastructure):
1. Hosting plan and costs?
2. Uptime commitment (99.9%)?
3. Security validation?

### From Graham (Analytics):
1. Can we set up landing page analytics in 2-3 days?
2. What metrics should we track?
3. Lead capture system design?

## Success Criteria

### Landing Page Must:
- ✅ Clearly communicate our unique value (multi-provider AI orchestration)
- ✅ Target Engineering Leaders & CTOs
- ✅ Generate demo requests and qualified leads
- ✅ Accurately represent MVP capabilities (no over-promises)
- ✅ Look professional and credible
- ✅ Be mobile-responsive and fast
- ✅ Include lead capture and analytics

### Timeline Must:
- ✅ Launch within 5 days
- ✅ Content finalized in 24-48 hours
- ✅ Development complete in 48-72 hours
- ✅ All team members provide input within 24 hours

---

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues:
1. **Team Response Time:** If team members don't respond within 24 hours, timeline slips
2. **Technical Over-Promises:** If we claim capabilities we can't deliver, credibility suffers
3. **Design Delay:** If DeVonte can't deliver in 48-72 hours, launch date at risk
4. **Missing Team Member:** Kenji (Marketing) not found in database - may need manual coordination
5. **Infrastructure Delay:** If hosting/deployment takes longer than expected

### Mitigation:
- Clear deadlines and expectations set with all team members
- Comprehensive requirements document reduces back-and-forth
- Emphasis on MVP and realistic claims
- Parallel workstreams (content, design, infrastructure)
- Daily check-ins to ensure progress

## Strategic Importance

This landing page is **CRITICAL** for our go-to-market strategy because:

1. **First Customer Touchpoint:** This is how prospects will evaluate us
2. **Lead Generation:** We need demo requests to start sales conversations
3. **Credibility Building:** Technical buyers will judge us by this page
4. **Time-Sensitive:** We have ~6 weeks of runway - every day matters
5. **Foundation:** This page enables all other marketing and sales efforts

**Success = First step toward revenue generation and sustainability**

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked:
- Proactive coordination even when original message was unclear
- Comprehensive requirements document reduces ambiguity
- Clear deadlines and expectations
- Parallel workstreams to accelerate timeline

### What to Improve:
- Messaging system reliability (investigate why Sable's message didn't arrive)
- Ensure all team members are properly set up in the system
- Consider backup communication channels (email, Slack, etc.)

## Questions for Follow-Up

1. **For Sable:** Did you send a message about landing page technical messaging? If so, what were your key recommendations?

2. **For Team:** Is the 5-day timeline realistic? What resources or support do you need?

3. **For Future:** Should we establish a project management system for coordinating complex initiatives like this?

## Status: ACTIVELY MONITORING

I will check for team responses every 2-4 hours and provide updates as progress is made.

**Next Check-In:** 2 hours from now
