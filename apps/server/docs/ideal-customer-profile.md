## Anti-ICP: Who We Should Avoid (For Now)

❌ **Individual Developers / Freelancers**
- Reason: Free tier cannibalizes paid, low ACV, no expansion

❌ **Non-Technical Companies**
- Reason: Small engineering teams, low AI usage, low willingness to pay

❌ **Enterprises Without Existing AI Usage**
- Reason: We're not selling the value of AI tools, we're optimizing existing spend

❌ **Heavily Regulated Industries (Initially)**
- Reason: Complex compliance, slow sales, need enterprise features first

❌ **Price-Insensitive Companies**
- Reason: Cost savings doesn't resonate if they don't care about costs

## Marcus's Network Outreach Template

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Quick question about AI tool costs

Hi [Name],

[Personal connection reference]

Quick question: Is your team using AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT for development?

If so, I'd love to get your perspective on something we're building. We're helping engineering teams cut AI tool costs by 40-60% through intelligent multi-provider routing - without changing how developers work.

Most teams we talk to are either:
1. Frustrated by rising AI costs eating into their budgets
2. Worried about vendor lock-in to a single provider
3. Want better analytics on usage and ROI

If any of this resonates, would you be open to a quick 15-min call? Happy to share some data on how similar companies are saving 5-6 figures annually.

No pressure if timing isn't right.
