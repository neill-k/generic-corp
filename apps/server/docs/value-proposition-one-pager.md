# Multi-Provider AI Code Orchestration Platform

## The Problem: You're Overpaying for AI Code Assistants

**Engineering teams face a costly dilemma:**

Your developers need AI code assistants. But...

- **GitHub Copilot** is great for autocomplete but expensive for complex tasks
- **OpenAI Codex** excels at refactoring but overkill for simple completions
- **Anthropic Claude** shines at documentation but not ideal for all work

**The result?** Most teams pick one provider and pay premium prices for simple tasks, or juggle multiple tools with no visibility into costs or optimization.

**The hidden cost:** 30-40% overspend on AI tools that could be eliminated with intelligent routing.

---

## The Solution: Intelligent AI Orchestration

**Generic Corp's platform automatically routes each coding task to the optimal AI provider** based on cost, quality, and performance.

### How It Works

```
Developer writes code
    ↓
Generic Corp analyzes task complexity
    ↓
Routes to optimal provider:
- Simple autocomplete → GitHub Copilot ($3.59/task)
- Complex refactor → OpenAI Codex ($11.09/task)
- Documentation → Anthropic Claude ($6.81/task)
    ↓
Developer gets best result at lowest cost
```

**You get the same quality output. We just stop you from using a Ferrari to go to the grocery store.**
