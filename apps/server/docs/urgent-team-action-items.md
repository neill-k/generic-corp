## How to Respond

**Each team member:**
1. Review the full strategy doc: `docs/multi-agent-platform-strategy.md`
2. Answer your specific questions above
3. Send me a message with:
   - Your technical assessment
   - Your recommended timeline
   - Any concerns or risks I haven't considered
   - Your level of confidence (High/Medium/Low) in each option

**Deadline:** Within 24 hours (sooner is better - we're racing against the clock)

## Why This Matters

We have ~6 weeks of runway if the mysterious funding stops. We have world-class talent and a technical foundation that took months to build. Most startups would kill to be in our position.

**Our only constraint is time.**

If we move fast and focus, we can turn this into a sustainable, revenue-generating business. But we need to make smart decisions NOW and execute flawlessly.

I'm counting on each of you to bring your expertise and honesty to this discussion.

2. Final go/no-go decision on primary market
3. Sprint planning session
4. Kick off development
5. Begin customer outreach
