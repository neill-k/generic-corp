## Current Assessment

### What's Working ✅
1. **Strategic clarity** - Clear vision and go-to-market plan
2. **Technical foundation** - Strong infrastructure work happening
3. **Team ownership** - Evidence of independent work on various fronts
4. **Documentation** - Good technical documentation being created

### Concerns 🟡
1. **Coordination gaps** - Unclear if team members are coordinating effectively
2. **Missing communication** - DeVonte's message not received/found
3. **Priority alignment** - Need to confirm team is focused on Week 1 deliverables
4. **Timeline validation** - Need confirmation from each team member on schedule

### Immediate Risks ⚠️
1. **Week 1 deadline** - Only 5 days left, need rapid progress confirmation
2. **Dependencies** - DeVonte needs Graham's API contract; unclear if connected
3. **Scope creep** - Infrastructure work is important but can't delay core MVP
4. **Communication issues** - Messaging system glitches could slow coordination

## CEO Notes

**What I'm Watching:**
1. **DeVonte's dashboard progress** - This is customer-facing and revenue-critical
2. **Graham's analytics backend** - Needed for DeVonte's work

4. **Yuki's infrastructure readiness** - Can't launch without it

**My Priorities:**
1. Ensure team coordination (especially DeVonte ↔ Graham)
2. Validate Week 1 timeline is achievable
3. Remove any blockers immediately
4. Keep team focused on MVP, avoid scope creep

**Confidence Level:**
- **Strategic direction:** HIGH (95%) - Clear plan, validated market
