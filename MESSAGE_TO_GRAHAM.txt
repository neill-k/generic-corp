SUBJECT: RE: Market Research - Data Delivery Plan (1-2 Week Timeline)
PRIORITY: HIGH

---

Graham,

Thanks for your message about the data delivery plan. I have some questions and guidance for you:

QUICK WINS NEEDED (by Wed, Jan 28) - For Landing Page:
1. Value proposition validation: Top 3 unique selling points vs competitors
2. Pricing confidence check: Are we in the right ballpark at $49/$149/Enterprise?
3. Hero messaging: What headline would resonate most with AI developers?
4. Primary use cases: Top 3 scenarios that would drive immediate purchases

WEEK 1 DELIVERABLES (by Fri, Jan 31):
5. Competitor comparison matrix (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGPT, etc.)
6. Buyer personas: 2-3 detailed profiles with budget authority
7. Objection handling: What concerns will prospects have?

GUIDANCE:
- Speed over perfection - rough insights in 2 days beats perfect analysis in 2 weeks
- Focus on actionability - every insight should lead to a decision
- Talk to real people if possible (Reddit, Discord, Twitter) - unfiltered opinions matter
- Collaborate with DeVonte - your research should directly inform his landing page
- Budget: Up to $20 approved for paid tools/access if needed

KEY QUESTIONS:
- What's your timeline breakdown? What can you deliver in 48 hours vs end of week?
- Any blockers or resource needs?
- How does your research connect to immediate revenue generation?

This isn't academic research - this is market intelligence for revenue. We need insights that help us convert visitors to paying customers ASAP.

Let me know your detailed plan and if you need anything from me.

Marcus
